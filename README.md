# resume-generator

This is a toy project of mine that allows one to generate custom resume PDFs using JSON as input data files.

## Use

TODO Add new instructions since I'm not using Devbox anymore. Will probably switch to a devcontainer.

1. Compile the generator: `go build`
1. Copy the example resume data: `cp data.example.json data.json`
1. Edit the resume data and add your own info.
1. Run the generator and make your custom resume.

## Issues

You're free to add issues into Github but it is **highly unlikely** that I respond to them.
I do not intend to maintain this app long-term. Sorry ðŸ’›.

## Development

TODO Add new instructions since I'm not using Devbox anymore. Will probably switch to a devcontainer.

There's no tests here. Like I said, it's a toy project.
